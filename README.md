# PixelCipher

PixelCipher is a C++ tool that encodes text into images by mapping characters to pixel colors. It provides a simple form of visual encryption, turning data into colored patterns that can be decoded back to text. Lightweight, fast, and ideal for basic [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) .

## Example Code

A minimal example showing how to load a [UTF-32 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32) text file and convert it into an encrypted image using `PixelCrypt`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "PixelCrypt.h"

int main() {
    std::u32string text = loadUTF32FromFile("./Book/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights.txt");

    PixelCrypt pc;

    pc.processsString(text); // outputs the resulting images in the same folder as the source text 
}
```

## Encrypted Works

Below are examples of famous texts and lyrics that have been visually encrypted using PixelCipher. Each entry includes the source and its corresponding `Data.bmp` output.

| Title                                      | Author              | Encrypted Image                                                                          |

## To-Do (Future Features)

- Decode image back to text  
- Set custom image size and padding  
- Use custom color palettes  
- Batch convert many files  
- Add password lock  
- Make a simple GUI  
- Check for decode errors  
- Store title/author in image

## File Structure

Each encoded text has a corresponding `Data.bmp` (visual data) and `Key.bmp` (color-key mapping) located in subfolders under `Book/` or `Song/`. These image pairs are generated by the PixelCipher tool and can be decoded back to the original text using the same key logic.
